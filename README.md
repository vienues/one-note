## About

OneNote is a note-taking app for the web. You can use the demo app at [onenote.dev](https://onenote.dev). It is a static site without a database and does not sync your notes to the cloud. The notes are persisted temporarily in local storage, but you can download all notes in markdown format as a zip.

Hidden within the code is an alternate version that contain a Node/Express server and integration with GitHub. This version involves creating an OAuth application for GitHub and signing up to it with private repository permissions. Instead of backing up to local storage, your notes will back up to a private repository in your account called `onenote-data`. Due to the following reasons I'm choosing not to deploy or maintain this portion of the application:

- I do not want to maintain a free app with users alongside my career and other commitments
- I do not want to request private repository permissions from users
- I do not want to maintain an active server
- I do not want to worry about GitHub rate limiting from the server
- There is no way to batch create many files from the GitHub API, leading to a suboptimal GitHub storage solution

However, I'm leaving the code available so you can feel free to host your own OneNote instance or study the code for learning purposes. I do not provide support or guidance for these purposes.

OneNote was created with TypeScript, React, Redux, Node, Express, Codemirror, Webpack, Jest, Cypress, Feather Icons, ESLint, and Mousetrap, among other awesome open-source software.

## Demo Development

Clone and install.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:taniarascia/onenote
cd onenote
npm i
```

Run a development server.

```bash
npm run client
```

## Full Application Development (self-hosted)

### Pre-Installation

Before working on OneNote locally, you must create a GitHub OAuth app for development.

Go to your GitHub profile settings, and click on **Developer Settings**.

Click the **New OAuth App** button.

- **Application name**: OneNote Development
- **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project, and add the app's client ID and secret. Remove `DEMO` variable to enable GitHub integration.

```bash
CLIENT_ID=xxx
CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
DEMO=true
```

> Change the URLs to port `5000` in production mode or Docker.

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:taniarascia/onenote
cd onenote
npm i
```

#### Development mode

In the development environment, an Express server is running on port `5000` to handle all API calls, and a hot Webpack dev server is running on port `3000` for the React frontend. To run both of these servers concurrently, run the `dev` command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to `localhost:3000` to view the app.

> API requests will be proxied to port `5000` automatically.

#### Production mode

In the production environment, the React app is built, and Express redirects all incoming requests to the `dist` directory on port `5000`.

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

Go to `localhost:5000` to view the app.

#### Run in Docker

Follow these instructions to build an image and run a container.

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build --build-arg CLIENT_ID=xxx -t onenote:mytag .

# Run Docker container in port 5000
docker run \
-e CLIENT_ID=xxx \
-e CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx \
-e NODE_ENV=development \
-p 5000:5000 \
onenote:mytag
```

Go to `localhost:5000` to view the app.

> Note: You will see some errors during the installation phase, but these are simply warnings that unnecessary packages do not exist, since the Node Alpine base image is minimal.

### Seed data

To seed the app with some test data, paste the contents of `seed.js` into your browser console.

## Testing

Run unit and component/integration tests.

```bash
npm run test
```

> If using Jest Runner in VSCode, add `"jestrunner.configPath": "config/jest.config.js"` to your settings

Run Cypress end-to-end tests.

```bash
# In one window, run the application
npm run client

# In another window, run the end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e:open
```
